Fork this repository to your GitHub and Clone to your computer.

Create a folder in your personal CofC webspace called portfolio.

 responsive design using the <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer> special HTML5 divs.

A professional headshot type picture should be to the left of this text, and when the screen resolution is phone-size, the text should go below neatly.

 Put your email address here in the following sneaky format: kbriggsATcofcDOTedu
Each one of your divs must have at least 3 CSS styles attributes assignments associate with them. All styles should be located in mainstyle.css.

You are not allowed to use any packaged templates although you can get color combinations ideas from http://www.colorcombos.com/ or sites similar to https://designschool.canva.com/blog/website-color-schemes/. You must come up with all the styles yourself. You are not allow to use any type of WYSIWYG software in this assignment. All html/CSS must be written from scratch in Webstorm or similar editor.
For each one of the courses in your portfolio create a sub folder named csci215, etc. Inside of each of these folder should be an html file identical to the parent index.hml, but the section should include the course’s course description, a link to a pdf of the syllabus for the course, and anything else you want to say about the course.

In your csci215 folder’s index.html, go ahead and include an Assignment 1 link to the pdf of this assignment.
For the other courses, you need to have at least 3 links to assignments that you have completed. These should include source code if applicable. If you want to include a course in which you are current enrolled, then just put placeholder inactive links for these assignments for now and upload them as the semester goes along.
Make sure you commit and push your code to Git and GitHub often.
