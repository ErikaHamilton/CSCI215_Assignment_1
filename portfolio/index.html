        Hello! Though my list of degrees may seem to be of random choosing,
        I can ensure you that they are not.
        I intend to pursue programming professionally.
        I believe that coming straight from college
        I may end up in a front-end development position,
        later leading to a software development position.
        However, my ultimate goal would to eventually end
        up in the world of computational physicsPerhaps I
        will be teaching, or better yet I'll work at NASA or Space-X,
        a job that I've dreamed about since I was child. </p>

            <p> During my time at the College of Charleston, I have taken
              Web Design, Python Programming, Website Programming, and Introduction to
              Computer Assembly Languages. Prior to college, I had a
              thorough understanding of HTML, DreamWeaver, Photoshop, and Flash.
              This past spring I also had taken
              a course entitled Practical Software Technology which covered a plethora
              of software technology including Jenkins, Redmine, SVN, GITHub, and more.
              To use this technology we also programmed in Java. </p>
